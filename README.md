# Movie Database ðŸŽ¬

During a one-day group project, my team made a website that let users compare their favourite movie with other films. I wanted to revisit the concept, the code we wrote, and the API we used.

I am using this repository to test different movie APIs. You will need your own API key in an .env file in order to run this project locally.
